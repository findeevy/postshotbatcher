# postshotbatcher

This is a tool for running multiple postshot frame training runs all at once from a folder of images, with the last three digit of the file name being the frame (IE camera_A_021 for frame number 21).

To run this first install python -> <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>

Then open up "IDLE" after it has installed.

Then go to open->postshotbatcher.py.

Then go to run -> run module.

Then copy in the path to your folder and the ksteps you want, and you're good to go!
